        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            The ATM Program has opened up natural talents I didn’t know I had, like I had always been interested in the general things like coding or designing, but who’d have guessed I’d actually be good at it right off the bat? This program has also helped me with the academic subjects, since some tech-savviness is required to type up essays, create videos, and make storyboards. I think the best part of the program is that it’s up-to-date and modern, and it’s essentially preparation for the future, since technology will only keep advancing. This is definitely a go-to for anyone with even the slightest passion for technology, and even those who just want to learn a bit more than average.
