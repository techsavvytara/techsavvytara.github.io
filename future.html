        <h2>My Future</h2>
        <h3>High School</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently planning on going to Lakewood High School or Millikan to enroll in their ATM program, as I still want to continue learning about computers.

            College
        </h3>
        <p>
            I plan to go to Long Beach City College or, if the opportunity presents itself, UCLA. They are both great colleges, and both have great computer programs.

        <h3>Career Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I've always had an interest in computers and technology, becoming obsessed at a young age. Naturally I aim to have a profession involving computers, or more specifically, video game design or programming.
