        <h2>My Future</h2>
        <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently attending Millikan High School to enroll in their MIT program, as I still want to continue learning about computer science- HTML, CSS, Python, Animation, etc. etc.

            <h3>
                College
            </h3>
            <p>
                For the time being I'm not sure where I should plan for college. I might go to Long Beach City College or, if the opportunity presents itself, UCLA. They are both great colleges, and both have great computer programs. My family also plans to move from California to Vermont once I graduate high school, so that could open up more possibilities for me.

        <h3>Career Interests</h3>
            <p>
                I've always had an interest in computers and technology, and so naturally I aim to have a profession involving computers, or more specifically, video game design or programming. I also want to run a webcomic as a hobby, paid or not.
